In order to keep learning curve low, piston reuses syntax of jstl core library. Tag libraries defined in piston are as following -

* html - tag library for html5 tags. There are some additional tags which make it easy to use various 'input' tags. See **in.koyad.piston.ui.taglib.html** package of piston-ui project for all the tags defined under this tag library.

* core - tag library for jstl core tags. It may not define all tags of jstl core tag library. At the same time some attributes are not supported while some extra attributes have been added to some tags. See **in.koyad.piston.ui.taglib.core** package of piston-ui project for all the tags defined under this tag library.

* portal - This library defines tags which are used in frame and portal page layout markup. See **in.koyad.piston.ui.taglib.portal** package of piston-ui project for all the tags defined under this tag library.

* plugin - This library defines tags which are used in plugin view xmls. See **in.koyad.piston.ui.taglib.plugin** package of piston-ui project for all the tags defined under this tag library.

Detailed documentation for all these tag libraries will be available soon.
