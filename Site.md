A site is a collection of pages which logically separates a hierarchy of pages from other pages.

Piston comes with three sites -

* Admin

	This site contains pages which are used for piston administration.

* Demo  

	This is a demo site.

* Design (Not developed yet)

	One of the issues with many open source projects is that documentation is not in sync with code. This site is an attempt to find a solution which generates some kind of (UML or otherwise) diagrams from code in real time eliminating the need to keep the documentation in sync with manually. 

* JIRA Extension (Not developed yet)

       I use Atlassian JIRA OnDemand/Cloud at work. Like many users of JIRA, there are some reports which I want to generate out of JIRA issues but I could not figure out any simple way to achieve this. To fill this gap I will be creating a site in piston which will act as a broker for Atlassian JIRA. This site will generate custom reports using JIRA rest api. Also there will be some additional features to make it easy to implement some common use cases.

* Wiki (Not developed yet)

       Open source wiki dedicated to documentation of open source projects. Knowledge of HTML and CSS is required.
